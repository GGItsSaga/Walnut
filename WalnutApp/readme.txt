For new users:
Click on "Create Account" and enter the information you need to use the program.

Encrypt: Ensure that the file you want to encrypt is in Walnut/WalnutApp so that the program can read
	the file.

Decrypt: Ensure that the file you want to decrypt is in Walnut/WalnutApp so that the program can read
	the file.

Access Public Log: Opens a .txt file that displays who encrypted and decrypted a file. When there 
	are no encryptions or decryptions, the file will not be there. If a user has encrypted or
	decrypted a file, it will show who did what at the time it was done.

**FOR ADMINS ONLY** 
Admins are able to change privlleges of users that use the Encryption API. They are also the only ones
	able to pull up account information.
